# min-raytracer

Minimalistic raytracer for the purpose of learning how raytracing works. I plan to add more features after understanding and finishing the essentials.

## How to use
``` bash
# compile with makefile
mingw32-make # on Windows with GNU installed
```

Compiling will produce an executable called minrt which will in turn produce the image.ppm.
